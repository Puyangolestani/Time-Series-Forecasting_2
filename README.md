# Time-Series-Forecasting_2

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Puyan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data enthusiast specializing in **time series forecasting**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization**. I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights and predictive models.

## ðŸ“Š Project: Store Sales Time Series Forecasting

In this project, I tackled the [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) challenge on Kaggle. The dataset originates from **CorporaciÃ³n Favorita**, a major Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, and includes:

- **Sales Data**: Daily sales figures for various products.
- **Promotional Information**: Details on product promotions.
- **Temporal Features**: Date-related attributes like day of the week, month, and year.

The objective was to predict future sales using machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on **XGBoost** for its performance and interpretability.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

The approach involved:

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating lag features, rolling statistics, and temporal attributes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and ensuring all features were numeric.
- **Modeling**: Implementing an iterative forecasting strategy with XGBoost.
-  **Evaluation & Visualization**: Predictions were visualized for the period **after 2017-08-15**, showing forecasted trends compared to historical data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The model successfully predicted sales for a 138-day horizon, capturing seasonal patterns and promotional impacts. Visualizations were created to compare historical and forecasted sales, providing clear insights into future trends.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Kaggle, GitHub

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and any preprocessing scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis and modeling process.
- `src/`: Source code for feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.
- `visualizations/`: Plots and charts illustrating the results.
